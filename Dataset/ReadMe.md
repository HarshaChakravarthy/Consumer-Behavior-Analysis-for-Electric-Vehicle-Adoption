This folder contains the dataset used for our project, specifically Electric Vehicle Population Data.

File:

Electric_Vehicle_Population_Data: The dataset encompasses a wide range of features, including 'Postal Code', 'Model Year', 'Make', 'Model', 'Electric Range', and 'Base MSRP'. Using these features, the primary objective is to develop predictive models capable of accurately forecasting the 'Electric Vehicle Type' that consumers are most likely to choose when making a purchase decision.
