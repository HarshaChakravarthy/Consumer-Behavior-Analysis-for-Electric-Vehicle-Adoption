# Consumer-Behavior-Analysis-for-Electric-Vehicle-Adoption

# Problem statement:
As the world progresses toward more sustainable modes of transportation, electric vehicles (EVs) have emerged as a viable alternative to traditional gasoline-powered automobiles.
However, high prices, limited range, and a lack of charging infrastructure keep preventing widespread EV adoption.
As a result, understanding consumer behavior surrounding EVs is critical for manufacturers, policymakers, and marketers.
Traditional methods of investigating consumer behavior, including as surveys and focus groups, are limited in their ability to capture real-time data and dynamic changes in consumer preferences.

# Dataset
The dataset encompasses a wide range of features, including 'Postal Code', 'Model Year', 'Make', 'Model', 'Electric Range', and 'Base MSRP'. Using these features, the primary objective is to develop predictive models capable of accurately forecasting the 'Electric Vehicle Type' that consumers are most likely to choose when making a purchase decision.

# Recommendations
Based on our analysis and conclusions, we propose the following measures for electric car advocacy groups to promote widespread use of electric vehicles:
Urban Focus: Concentrate efforts on promoting the use of electric vehicles in urban areas, where there are more EVs and the impact on lowering emissions and congestion can be greater.

Collaboration with Electric Utility Companies: Work with electric utility companies to guarantee that charging infrastructure is in place and to promote the use of renewable energy sources to power electric vehicles, which aligns with sustainability objectives.

Public Charging Station Advocacy: Promote the establishment of more public charging stations to alleviate range anxiety and improve the convenience of owning an electric vehicle.

Focused Marketing and Incentive Promotion: Use the data gained from the make, model, and pricing study to create focused marketing campaigns and raise awareness of clean alternative fuel vehicle incentives in locations with low adoption rates.


# Conclusion
By utilizing the prediction models created in this study and executing the proposed techniques, electric car advocacy groups can effectively aid in the transition to a more sustainable transportation system. The broad use of electric vehicles will not only reduce carbon emissions, but will also help to create a cleaner, more environmentally friendly future.
